\description{
  Convenience functions to enable or disable the axis
  primary or secondary ticks.

  \code{theme_noprimary} or \code{theme_hideprimary}
  (Alias) are functions that apepnds to the current theme a
  flag to switch OFF the primary ticks

  \code{theme_showprimary} is a function that apepnds to
  the current theme a flag to switch ON the primary ticks

  \code{theme_nosecondary} or \code{theme_hidesecondary}
  (Alias) are functions that apepnds to the current theme a
  flag to switch OFF the secondary ticks

  \code{theme_showsecondary} is a function that apepnds to
  the current theme a flag to switch ON the secondary ticks

  \code{theme_showticks(), themehideticks(),
  theme_noticks()} are functions that switch ON or OFF BOTH
  the primary or secondary ticks.
}
\details{
  In \code{ggtern}, the primary ticks are deemed as being
  the ticks along the binary axis increasing to the apex
  species, primary ticks can consist of both major and
  minor ticks (major ticks have labels, and are generally
  longer and bolder). Therefore, there are three (3) sets
  of major primary ticks, and, three (3) sets of minor
  primary ticks.

  These convenience functions introduce the concept of
  secondary ticks, which, are the same items however on the
  'opposing' binary axis.

  For example, considering the TOP apex species, in a plot
  with 'clockwise' axis precession, the primary ticks would
  run along the LHS, whilst, the secondary ticks, woudl run
  along the RHS. By default, the primary ticks are switched
  ON, whilst the secondary ticks are switched OFF and are
  controlled by the
  \code{\link{axis.tern.ticks.showprimary}} and
  \code{\link{axis.tern.ticks.showsecondary}} theme
  elements respectively.
