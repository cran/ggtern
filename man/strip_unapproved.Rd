\description{
  \code{strip_unapproved} is a function which essentially
  'deletes' layers from the current ternary plot, if such
  layers are not one of the approved layers. The current
  list of approved layers are as follows: \itemize{
  \item{point, path, segment and polygon} \item{Tline,
  Lline and Rline} \item{smooth and density2d-ggtern}
  \item{text} \item{rug} } The balance of the available
  geometries to ggplot2 are either dissaproved, or, work in
  progress with regards to this package.
