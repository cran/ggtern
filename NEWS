ggtern 1.0.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
BUG FIXES
* Fixed broken patch in geom_density2d()

ggtern 1.0.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Grid rendered AFTER border
* Documentation Improvements
* Inclusion of USDA Soil Classification Data, accessed by: data(USDA)
* Creation of New geometries for ternary errorbars, ie, geom_errorbarT, geom_errorbarL and geom_errorbarR
* Creation of convenience functions (theme_showtitles and theme_hidetitles) for hiding or showing the apex titles
* Creation of convenience functions (theme_showlabels and theme_hidelabels) for hiding or showing the axis ticklabels
* Better handling of convenience functions for hiding (and showing which is new) major or minor gridlines
* Improvement on arrow positioning relative to ticks and axis labels.
* Convenience function for the setting of the ternary arrow baseline (theme_arrowbaseline(value))
* Removal of grid elements for existing axes (ie not just using blank elements)
* Creation of theme_minimal, equivalent to the ggplot2 version.
* Creation of theme_classic, equivalent to the ggplot2 version.
* Creation of Multiplot function, for arranging multiple plots.
* Changed the default mapping T=y, L=x and R=z, since it is likely that people new to ternary plots will find this more intuitive, created global options so this can be modified.
* Modified logic so that T, L and R ALWAYS relate to the Top, Left and Right apex, regardless of assignment in coord_tern(...).

BUG FIXES
* Labels not assigning correctly when coord_tern() not using default x,y,z mapping.
* Error in geom_confidence wrt clockwise (existing dependency on ternary.options)

ggtern 1.0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Ordering of grid rendering was changed relative to the remaining background items

* Global tern.clockwise option was created

* Changed default procession from anticlockwise to clockwise

* Theme nomleclature has been made more like the ggplot2 nomleclature, in the sense that
  ORIGINAL                SUPERCEDED BY             ALIASES
  theme_tern_bw()         -> theme_bw()
  theme_tern_gray()       -> theme_gray()           theme_grey()
  theme_tern_rgbg()       -> theme_rgbg()           theme_rgb()
  theme_tern_rgbw()       -> theme_rgbw()

* Theme nomleclature improved for some unique ternary functions.
  ORIGINAL                SUPERCEDED BY             ALIASES
  theme_tern_nogrid_major -> theme_nogrid_major()   tern_nogrid_major()
  theme_tern_nogrid_minor -> theme_nogrid_minor()   tern_nogrid_minor()
  theme_tern_nogrid       -> theme_nogrid()         tern_nogrid()

* Better Documentation for Theme Convenience Functions
  

* In the above themes, they have furthermore been slightly changed to be more consistent
  with that of ggplot2, in terms of the minor and major colors for the default theme_gray.

* Error protocols for version control implemented, same as ggplot2, however, for ggtern.

* New theme elements option for putting ticks INSIDE or OUTSIDE of the axis, OUTSIDE is default. 
  Convenience functions also created theme_ticksoutside() and theme_ticksinside()

* Clockwise/Anticlockwise axis precession is now controlled by the theme element 'axis.tern.clockwise', as a 'logical'.

* Length of theme elements in 'units', such as major and minor ticks.

* element_ternary fully depreciated in favour of individual theme elements.

* Added functionality for 'secondary ticks' and convenience functions theme_showsecondary(), theme_hidesecondary(), theme_showprimary(), theme_hideprimary()

BUG FIXES

* Correction to logic in .theme_new internal function

* Correction to theme_nogrid(), so that it could be 'added' to other themes.

* Correction to theme element logic when switching between printing of ggplot2 and ggtern objects.

* Ticks rendered after grid, previously it was the other way around, 
  obvious since inside ticks have been introduced.

* last_coord set to NULL during onLoad, originally it was set to coord_tern(), which was necessary for the default theme elements, however, 
  is presumptuous in terms of what te user will actually plot.

* Correction of padding by aspect ratio, which was introducing small errrors in ticks, noticiable for long tick sizes.

* Restructured cood_tern() and how it renderd the ternary elements, distinct functions were broken off from the main render_bg routine.

* Correction to throwing points in geom_smooth set, when coordinate limits != c(0,1)

* .theme_nocart(), which destroys all cartesian theme elements, is now applied EVERY TIME a ggtern object is rendered. Previously, if a new theme (say theme_bw()) is applied to an EXISTING ggtern plot (ie plot + theme_bw()), some cartesian theme elements were creeping back into the plot.

ggtern 1.0.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Package accepted for CRAN

BUG FIXES

* Coordinate system was not working as expected when theme_clockwise()
  was used.
